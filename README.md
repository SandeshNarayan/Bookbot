# Bookbot
My first project! 
I am going to build "Book Bot" - a Python program that can analyze an entire book and print out an interesting statistical report. 

A few of the learning goals are:

1. Configure a professional Python development environment on local computer
2. Deploy a Python project on personal GitHub account
3. Learn how to use a professional code editor (VS Code)
4. Put Python and Git skills to the test in a real project

Skills required:

1. Python 
2. CLI (Shells and Terminals )
3. Git and GitHub
